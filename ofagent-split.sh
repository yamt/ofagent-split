# Use this script to split advanced services out of Neutron.
# Derived from oslo graduation script.
#
# To use:
#
#  1. Clone a copy of the neutron repository to be manipulated.
#  2. cd into the neutron repo to be changed.
#  3. Checkout each remote branch, to ensure there is a local copy.
#  4. Run this script
#  5. FIX THE .gitreview FILE IN THE RESULTING OUTPUT REPO
#  6. To push this repo somewhere remote, use "git push --all && git push --tags"
